# Project
A simple Jenkins CI/CD application deployment pipeline to Kubernetes on the AWS infrastructure. Automated with Terraform 

# Requirements
AWS Infrastructure
VPC following AWS best practice with public and private subnets
Jenkins
GitOps or equivalent
EKS

# Requirements Overview
Developers check-in code to Git repo, Upon Git check-in Jenkins build starts Jenkins build pushed docker image to ECR. 
Jenkins then deploys application image to EKS. User should be able to test deployed application with browser

# Steps 
Setting Up Jenkins on AWS Using Terraform

In this guide, we'll set up a Jenkins server on AWS using Terraform, a tool for infrastructure as code.

We will configure AWS credentials or profiles that Terraform will use to create resources in AWS is a crucial step in the process. Here's how to do it:

# Step 1: Set Up AWS Credentials

* AWS CLI Installation: If you haven't already, install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

* AWS Account: Ensure you have an AWS account with IAM user(you may give it admin previlege) having  the necessary permissions to create EC2 instances, security groups, and other resources.

* AWS Access Key and Secret Key: Obtain your AWS access key ID and secret access key. These are the credentials Terraform will use to authenticate with AWS.

# Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Open a terminal and run the following command to configure AWS CLI:
`Ã ws configure`

You will be prompted to enter:
* AWS Access Key ID: Enter your access key ID.
* AWS Secret Access Key: Enter your secret access key.
* Default region name: Specify your preferred AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
* Default output format: You can leave this as the default (e.g., json).

## Step 3: Terraform Script

We have a Terraform script in a repository that automates Jenkins server setup. You can access it here.

## Step 4: Customize

Modify the script as needed for your project, including instance type(as we know is better to use a suitable instance type for jenkins, i recommend using atleast for this project a t2.medium), region, and specific Jenkins configurations.

## Step 5: Execution
Execute the Terraform script:
* {terraform init
* terraform apply}

Step 4: Post-Deployment
Access the Jenkins web interface using the public ipv4 address. configure Jenkins.

# Installing the right plugins for our project




and set up jobs and pipelines as required.
